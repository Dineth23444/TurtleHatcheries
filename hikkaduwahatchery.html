            <h2>About the Hatchery</h2>
            <p>
              The Hikkaduwa Turtle Hatchery is a conservation center located in Hikkaduwa, Sri Lanka. It plays a crucial role in protecting sea turtles and their eggs, as well as educating visitors about these fascinating creatures.
            </p>
            <p>
              The hatchery works closely with local communities and volunteers to ensure the safety and well-being of sea turtles. It serves as a sanctuary for injured and orphaned turtles, providing medical care and a nurturing environment for their rehabilitation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Additionally, the hatchery actively engages in turtle conservation efforts by conducting research, monitoring nesting sites, and releasing hatchlings into the ocean. Visitors have the opportunity to witness these releases and learn about the hatchery's vital conservation work.
            </p>
            <p>
              Its Conservation Efforts
              Presently, there are five species of turtles that are taken care of in the hatchery and rescue centre. 
              Such species are the Olive Ridley Turtle, Leatherback Turtle, Loggerhead Turtle, Hawksbill Turtle, and Green 
              Turtle. The facilities of the sea turtle hatchery and rescue centre are all state-of-the-art, complete with water 
              tanks to care for newborn turtles, along with adult turtle species that have been rescued from the sea due to 
              injuries. One of the more peculiar sights in the centre is the area in which the turtles lay their eggs, as 
              they have distinct little mounds of sand piled neatly between one another. Each of these mounds is monitored 
              closely to calculate the hatching process of the turtle eggs.
