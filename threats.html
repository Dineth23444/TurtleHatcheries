                    Solid waste, chemicals and pollutants from human activities enter the ocean, causing injury, 
                    illness and even death to sea turtles. The pollution sources range from wastewater discharge released by 
                    cruise liners to fishing nets that are lost by fishermen to fertilizer runoff that comes down rivers from 
                    farms. This means that even people living in the middle of the European Union can have an impact on the health
                    of the oceans and sea turtles.<br><br>
                    Thousands of  chemicals contaminate the marine environment, many of which accumulate in the tissues of sea 
                    turtles, affecting their locomotion, brain functioning and reproductive success. Sea turtles also consume 
                    plastics and marine debris which are harmful to their digestive systems. Scientists believe that there may 
                    be a link between exposure to agricultural pollutants and the spread and prevalence of fibropapillomatosis, 
                    a disease in sea turtles that causes tumors to grow on the eyes, intestinal tracts, lungs, mouth, heart and 
                    other organs.

                    Each year, more than six million tons of trash enters the oceans, with plastics comprising up to 90 percent. 
                    Marine trash poses an entanglement and ingestion hazard to turtles, threatening their ability to forage, 
                    grow and, ultimately, survive. A study conducted on young loggerhead turtles found that 15 percent of the 
                    turtles had ingested large amounts of plastics that blocked their stomach from functioning.

                    Sea turtles cannot breathe under water and their regular ascent to the surface puts sea turtles directly 
                    in the path of boats. Commercial and recreational vessels are major turtle harzards, particularly in shipping 
                    lanes and during peak tourism months when millions of recreational boaters congregate in coastal areas.<br><br>
                    Boat collisions are one of the main identified  source of trauma for turtles found stranded and dead on 
                    Mediterranean beaches. Injuries from boat propellers include amputated flippers, fractured shells, brain 
                    injuries and broken bones. Although not all of these injuries cause  immediate death, they may provoke  
                    elevated levels of stress or injuries, which ultimately affect a sea turtle's ability to forage, migrate, 
                    escape from predators and reproduce.
