                Sri Lanka is known for its diverse turtle population and is home to several species of turtles that nest and 
                thrive along its coastal areas. Sea turtles are fascinating creatures that have been living in our oceans for 
                millions of years. In Sri Lanka, these creatures have a special place in the hearts of locals and tourists alike. 
                The island is home to five of the seven known species of sea turtles.Such species are the Olive Ridley Turtle, 
                Leatherback Turtle, Loggerhead Turtle,
                 Hawksbill Turtle, and Green Turtle.

                However, these amazing creatures are under threat due to human activities and climate change. We'll explore the 
                unique features of Sri Lanka's sea turtles, the challenges they face, and the conservation efforts being 
                undertaken to protect them. The island nation, located in the Indian Ocean, is home to several species of turtles, both marine and freshwater. These turtles play a vital role in Sri Lanka's ecosystem and have cultural and economic significance for the country.
